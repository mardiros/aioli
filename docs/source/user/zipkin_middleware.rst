Tracing using Zipkin Middleware
===============================

In microservices architecture, to troubleshoot problems, it is convenient
to trace all sub requests and more using a tracer such as Zipkin or Jaeger.

In blacksmith, the zipkin middleware can be added to trace all the sub requests.

Example using starlette_zipkin:

::

   import starlette_zipkin

   from blacksmith import ClientFactory, ConsulDiscovery
   from blacksmith.middleware.zipkin import ZipkinMiddleware

   sd = ConsulDiscovery()
   cli = ClientFactory(sd)
   cli.add_middleware(
      ZipkinMiddleware(starlette_zipkin.get_root_span, starlette_zipkin.get_tracer)
   )
